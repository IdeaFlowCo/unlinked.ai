My focus will be on your ability to balance communication and correctness during the exercise - in short, software fluency.   How's that sound?",INBOX

I design a lot of their digital content that goes out (webpages, emails, etc.)  BUT  I also build web apps in my spare time, like one of my recent creations ""Plates"" a task management tool for people with ADHD that is designed to help you break your tasks down into bite-sized pieces.

Here’s the deal: you need top-tier talent that doesn’t eat up all your time, money, and sanity. That’s where 8020Recruit steps in. We specialize in finding LATAM professionals who are skilled, pre-vetted, and working in US time zones—so no 2 AM Slack messages or surprise ""out-of-office"" days.  Here’s the kicker:  You’re in control—we don’t manage your team, you do. So, you get all the benefits of team building and productivity tracking without any extra fees.  One-time recruiting fee, and that’s it. No recurring charges. No hidden costs. Just top-notch talent, ready to go.  Time savings—we’ll save you 20-30 hours of searching, interviewing, and vetting. That’s time you could spend, you know, doing important stuff.  100% guaranteed hires—depending on the position, you’re covered for 30-90 days. If it doesn’t work out, we’ll make it right.  Basically, we make hiring easier, faster, and way less painful. And, let’s face it—who doesn’t need that? Let’s set up a quick chat to see how we can save you some time and maybe a few gray hairs.

When I saw your profile, I knew I had to reach out and say hi.  I love the ethos behind Intelligence Amplification, especially in contrast to modelling it as a Second Brain. I think it's vital in this new era of AI for humans to massively upskill ourselves lest we find ourselves made redundant. At the same time, it is by using ML/NLP/LLMs optimally that we can achieve such rapid gains..   My research focus over the last 2 years has been tuned towards how careful and precise applications of these SuperIntelligent But Very Dumb Tools can augment and enhance human learning on a potentially exponential level. The usage of these tools in this space can go far beyond summaries and rephrasing, essential though they are.     Here's a sample interface we built for Roam Research some years ago:  https://youtu.be/5sKlLK7QuMI?si=Sf_f5CDbXZ-_DDWy   There are many tangents associated with this space that I think we can have a very interesting discussion about, do let me know your availability. Some topics of my interest: Ethical Gamification, Learning Trees, Augmenting & Enhancing Memory, and I'm sure you'll have your own list :) Furthermore, I believe that I can contribute immensely to Ideaflow at this stage, as someone who has studied the problem space as well as the LLM oppurtunity space. There are a few roles from your Careers page that caught my eye, looking forward to discussing those too.   Cheers Anirudh",INBOX

This event will bring together Korea’s top SaaS companies and key U.S. partners in Silicon Valley.  Most founders find themselves spending much time looking for & trying to connect with investors/VCs - only to find out that either -they're not a good fit for you as an investor (different focus, stages, regions, etc.) OR -they're not actively investing in any startups right now  The reality is that even though there are technically over 10,000,000 investors worldwide, only about 300,000 of them are active at any point in time. So, trying to find & connect with your ideal investors - ones that align with what you do AND have the capacity to invest - can be like searching for a needle in a haystack.  At K-Global@Silicon Valley, you’ll: - Meet leading Korean SaaS companies specialising in AI, API development, and big data. - Network with 50+ Korean VCs and CVCs, exploring collaboration possibilities. - Discuss tech trends and opportunities with Korean government leaders and industry experts.  Event Details: Date: September 26-27 (select an hour of your free time) Venue: Santa Clara Marriott Hotel Attendance: FREE, but limited to 30 spots.  We would love to meet you at the event and if you need more details, I am more than happy to have a quick call.  If this is something you’d be interested in, you can register here https://lu.ma/wvo7lhgn?tk=m9LbVA  Let me know once you're done.  We are looking forward to seeing you there!

How?   This is called Pre-influence or Pre-suasion. (It’s not a new thought)   We have an LinkedIn Event and PR led - unique client generation platform. Flexible options. Cesar & I personally run it for a few clients.    Perfect for smaller businesses who need smaller volume,  but warmed-up highly converting leads to unlock growth.  🙌   Is this of interest? Sharing Cesar’s calendar here if so.    No worries at all if it’s not a fit, as we’re not for everyone!   All the best, Jimmy T. 😀 https://calendly.com/coachcesar/intro-call",INBOX

I was trained at Oracle, was part of the original Netscape team (working with Clarke and Andreessen), and worked under Reed Hastings at his first startup, Pure Software, which we sold to fund Netflix.   I co-founded the NLP start-up Thankful.ai, which I sold to Gladly.ai EOY 2023. Most recently, as CRO, I was able to 20x revenue for Nordic NLP/NLU start-up Boost.ai over four years, bringing them out of Europe and making them a legitimate player in the Americas and WW.   For the last year, I have been building out a culture-focused LLM platform based on first-party data of 25mm Gen Z users to quantify trends and target the post-advertising consumer (Gen Z and Gen Alph who do not click on ads, opt in, etc.).   I have deep, successful experience building sales and marketing teams, demand generation engines, GTM, and sustainable and recurring hyperbolic revenue machines.

What particularly excites me is the opportunity to be part of a company that's pioneering the way we interact with technology.

Also - you know - currency exchange 😉  At heart I'm a Motion Designer, tho’ knack for spacetime improvement has led me to process optimization and animation automation – which could be valuable for future workflows. For current needs I also bring knowledge gathered across multiple design and marketing teams – ranging from UI & UX to best advertising practices and copywriting, a skillset I think could be of use for the team's expansion.   Take a peek at my reel to check whether you see Ideaflow resonating in there.  If so - lmk – for sure we can figure something out.   🌴 Aloha! 🌴  www.behance.net/gallery/193475245/showReel",INBOX

I'm sure you are looking to fill a few software engineering roles -- this is very much what we work on day in and day out here at Cadre.

Gathering the tribe of toolmakers and personal information management aficionados Feedback,"Hi Jacob,    Thanks for taking this cold in-mail.     I'm an investor looking for acquisition opportunities in the $1m-$20m(ish) revenue range.     Unfortunately most of the business owners I talk to aren't really prepared for a sale, at least not at the multiple they want.    So I've started helping owners who may want to sell in the future to build their business with the end in mind so they can grow and scale in a way that maximizes their exit multiple.    We've got proven strategies and frameworks that can turn decades into years and years into months.    If you're having any challenges with growth, scalability or exit prep in any way I'm here to help.    Are you open to a conversation around either topic (selling or scaling as prep for exit)    -Samuel-  boomenterprises.io  https://calendly.com/coffeedates",INBOX

I would like to share more information about our scientific approach at Inventurist with you.  How is Inventurist different?  Current AI models (e.g., LLMs) learn about the world similar to how humans learn to ride a bike or play tennis. The learning is implicit and can't be explained to other people how it’s done. That's why kids don’t need to understand physics before learning how to ride a bike! That's why people can't explain how they can ride a bike without falling down unless they learn physics -- the principles of gyroscopic effect, steering dynamics, etc.    In contrast, the learnings of Inventurist AI are explicit like learning about science or mathematics. Inventurist AI learns about the fundamentals of a business domain by making sense of relationships between growth signals and their cause and effects. The 'sensemaking' ability of Inventurist AI automatically captures the what, the how, and the why in a way that can be explained and verified by people.  What is the value of Inventurist's differentiation?  By synthesizing and maintaining explicit AI models of growth drivers in an industry or a business domain, Inventurist AI can make predictions about future opportunities and risk factors – and provide the supporting evidence behind those predictions. Our customers use models built by Inventurist AI to run what-if scenarios and receive prescriptive recommendations about growth opportunities and risks in their business domains. Inventurist’s AI models are not black boxes.  Why now?  Automatically constructing and maintaining explicit AI models have not been possible before. Manually building such models was as expensive, time-consuming, and complex as teaching people new skills (such as skills for analyzing growth opportunities in a business domain). With Inventurist's Sensemaking AI we are now able to emulate humans' explicit learning capabilities and automate building and maintaining such models on a massive scale and with a lightning speed!  What proof points do we have? We have a working platform in production with backtesting capabilities, customer and investor testimonials, and a growing sales funnel.   Please let me know if this is of interest and if you would like to have further discussion.    Thanks, Gil",INBOX

We didn't actually talk, I mostly talked with Max, but my wife and I live in Los Altos and have been coming to Nosara for over a decade this time of year. Alas, time to go back to the Bay Area late next week. And I've been in tech for decades providing teams of engineers from Costa Rica and other countries in LATAM to US startups and larger companies. Sold the company 4 years ago and now I'm mostly advising startups. Hope your time in Nosara was very enjoyable.  And I wanted to check out the app but it looks like you don't get have an Android version.  Pura vida, Mario",INBOX

Over the past half-century, plants and soil have consistently absorbed about 30% of carbon dioxide emissions, even as those emissions increased by 50% over that period. Oceans have also helped, soaking up more than 20%.  Unfortunately, our carbon sinks are under pressure with the Amazon now releasing more carbon than it absorbs. This means that we can no longer depend on some of the world’s largest carbon sinks to help absorb growing emissions.  Join us for a lively discussion and learn how sustainability professionals and businesses can help to protect and support “Carbon sinks”.  This interactive panel discussion will offer a practical guide on how different “Carbon Sinks & Offsetting” measures work and how we can support them as an individual and/or business.

To embrace solar punk means seeking to get to a future that is an apex of our wishes in as realistic a path as possible as quickly as practical. There are as many dimensions of our collective hopes for the future as are imaginable in our extremely neuro-diverse world. Each person’s specific form of interdisciplinary understanding can bring new ideas and fresh social innovations into the world and help shift us into a new future. Any given mind represents a unique key to unlocking a future in which extraordinary capabilities are unleashed for collective benefit. . It’s the best way I know to get to a future I care about – one that is aligned to a panoply of collective wishes, goals, and hopes.        Unique combinations of capability matter. The Ikigai principle emphasizes the importance of seeking the overlap between what you are exceptional at, what you love doing, what the world needs you to be doing, and what is rewarding for you to do. Everyone can better align themselves with their ideal portfolio of roles—and when that happens, the unique blend of their skills and passions can have extraordinary impact.        At CrowdDoing we call this process of deconstructing and customizing a person’s or an organization’s role and sharing it with other collaborators via “role fracturing”. We call adding contiguous dimensions to align with a person’s ideal role “function stacking”. Both are possible at vast scales for individuals, institutions, or coalitions. Offering indviduals this improved portfolio of alignment can allow systems change initiatives stewarded by our ecosystem to have transformative potential.        We’ll be evaluating our success as a network based on whether our cherished but challenging aspirations become more feasible. Let’s be solar punks together.",INBOX

Maybe worth exploring next week: The intersection between Solarpunks (creativity, utopia, sustainability) and Systems Thinking/Innovation seems promising. I'd be happy to explore potential projects - for example, Henning, a friend of mine, wrote a mission report about the no man's land between Hamburg and Berlin (180miles) - with a clear hint towards creating sustainable mini-eco systems featuring wind or solar fueled wood-based homes. With the rise of autonomous vehicles (see Tesla's Berlin factory) and awesome tiny house companies from Estonia (like Koda) and Shell's billion-dollar fund for sustainable energy solutions, there might be a sweet spot to realize utopias.",INBOX

Not all that is unsolved is solved. I think of systems change as often solving problems people didn't realize were problems but once solved unleash the potential fo the community to address their collective challenges. Not all of the problems of the world are formal problems in theory. Heuristics such as Moore's law is not a problem solution or a proof in and of itself but a singularity navigation/uncertainty navigation/asymptote navigation tool nonetheless. Systems change problem solving is where we get aspirations to be more feasible with grace. Fermat's last theorum was an important problem to solve for theory but not all problem are equally connectable to addressing shared value concerns of climate change, bio-diversity collapse, upward mobility gap,etc.",INBOX

With regard to appealing the the 1/3 of the public that is ""persuadable,"" I suggest aspirational storytelling is key... because in my own life that is what enabled me to escape a family dynamic that mirrored the ""war against the truth"" that exists in America, the UK and other nations today.  My father was a malignant narcissist (like Trump).

It challenges the core of our financial system, calling for the adoption of new paradigms, structures, and practices along all stages of the investment process. TransCap is a very different approach than what mainstream financial institutions are accustomed to. As a consequence, my lived experience of talking to big-brand investment professionals is characterized by blank stares and awkward pauses. I sometimes have to cut entire elements from the narrative to not turn off my audience, and I have yet to find a mainstream financial institution willing to engage with TransCap in a meaningful way. Clearly, there is no “market” for this “product” yet. On an emotional level, this is frustrating. But on a rational level, I have come to understand that a weak product/market fit is exactly what’s needed for systems innovation.""",INBOX

One third of the population at large will support an approach and one third will oppose it. The game is the get the support of the persuadables that comprise the remaining third. Parts of our discussion created an imagery of a debate about human nature. The references to our better nature led me to think we need to consider how pursuit of self-interest is the counterweight, and its hard to see how those two views can find a way to cooperate. Steve Brant's reference to Naomi Klein's rhetorical question--""What kind of people do we want to be?""-- illuminates a possible way forward, a way to appeal to the persuadables. Experiments that test this idea, I think, should begin on a small scale. Where they succeed, they have potential to fuel larger changes.  That's due to the power of another social quality--the tendency to imitate what works.",INBOX

Join us on Tuesday, 23rd February at 17:00 CET to discover why diversity in currency systems will be more beneficial for people, the economy and the planet than our singular money system.  Our distinguished guests: Sarah Bird, CEO of Timebanking UK Brett Scott, Senior Fellow of Finance Innovation Lab Amber Bieg, Chief Marketing Officer of The Joule Case Will Ruddick, Founder of Grassroots Economics  REGISTER HERE: https://bit.ly/3aODgNV  Looking forward to seeing you!",INBOX

We can identify with our interests, our narratives, and our context. I hope that in the future we'll get to enjoy the context that we get to live in a world in which more people can work on what they love. Likewise, may that be a world in which the SDGs and beyond have been achieved.  We have wishes and we have super-powers. Collaboration is the super-power. Our collaboration gap can overcome any learned helplessness we feel individually facing the future. We have transformational agency in autonomy collaboratively but not in isolation. Autopoiesis is a goal of our co-conspiratorial dialogue summoning imagination and instigating integration. Let's be in cahoots for systems change here today at noon pst. #systemschange meet.google.com/azg-fenv-htq Join by phone ‪+1 505-738-2987‬ PIN: ‪345 674 821‬#",INBOX

I was inspired by Grant's great share above to invite you all to have a look, as well. It's called CoLiberate: Unconference of Black and Brown Entrepreneurs for Social Justice, and is rooted in the belief that the transition to the next economy here in the US must be led by Black and Brown communities. At the same time, you'll see that we've created space for ally entrepreneurs as well as ecosystem-builders, who may or may not identify as Black or Brown. Whether you're able to attend, make a financial contribution, and/or simply share it here on LinkedIn, I'm grateful for all of it and for the work you all do in the various corners of our world: https://www.coliberate.us/",INBOX

I find that link fascinating, Nick. ""The future of humanity does depend on persuading people to be rational."" I think that goes to the hyper-realistic part. But if we're to not be as hyper-aspirational as we wish people to be hyper-realistic, we won't be inspired enough to navigate towards a future worth cherishing for shared value and meaning. So lets mashup the aspirational realistic imminent hypothetically and through dialectic re-route when we find we've lost the path and the white water raft so we need to re-orient as we can't fly when it comes to waterfalls. -Bobby",INBOX

What is your “drakes equation” for getting to a solar punk world? Building a feasible road to a possibility can be achieved via the metaphor of  “drakes equation” development. Even if we fail to build a road but just build a river we can white water raft down to a solar punk world I’d be totally happy. So in that spirit I thought I’d share my initial quick thesis from half an hour thinking about it might go something like:    SIRR * IC *ILNIP * PSI* ERPR* ARD* OSG* SICR* SIICVDAO= Systems change rate corresponding to solar punk world arrival time.    Acceleration of the rate of social innovation replication rate,  (SIRR)  Acceleration of the rate of interdisciplinary citation (IC)  Integration of inter-disciplinary learning, narrative, and impact potential (ILNIP)  Acceleration of the rate of participation in social innovation (PSI)  Acceleration of the rate of stakeholders early responsibility for preventing their risk through the provision of social innovation (ERPR)  Diversification of the impact goals that affect us, to include the aspirational realistic across dimensionalities (ARD)  Integration of outcomes achieved with stakeholders gratitude feedback loops  (OSG)  Social innovation clustering rate proportionate to shared aspirations (SICR)  Social innovation iteration rate proportionate to context variation by design anticipatory omniscience  (SIICVDAO)    For those of you not familiar,  “ N= The number of civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy whose electromagnetic emissions are detectable.  R*= The rate of formation of stars suitable for the development of intelligent life (number per year).  fp= The fraction of those stars with planetary systems.  ne= The number of planets, per solar system, with an environment suitable for life.  fl= The fraction of suitable planets on which life actually appears.  fi= The fraction of life bearing planets on which intelligent life emerges.  fc= The fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that produces detectable signs of their existence.

I love the quote of "" In 1911, Frederick Winslow Taylor, the efficiency expert, wrote ""In the past the man has been first; in the future the system must be first.”"". I was going to share one part of a conversation I had this week. Think tanks are either realistic but not aspirational enough, or they are aspirational without being realistic. Hyper-aspirational, hyper-realistic as the Pareto optimality equivalent for systems change makes sense to me. Pinchot Index (https://www.amazon.com/Pinchot-Impact-Index-Measuring-Aggregating/dp/0692396519) identifies risk and impact reward. Maybe all the stakeholders could champion systems change based on their peace with nature dividend? They talk about post-war dividends. If we are too often at war with nature rather than in collaboration with nature, can we create the prospect of the peace with nature dividend to drive global adoption of our strategic narratives?",INBOX

I agree with @Yangbo Du, NLPC seems to be a spurious publication. However, the research paper that it mentions is not spurious, so I will use it as a comparison to the NYT article.   I read the introduction, background and conclusion (not the mathematical portions yet) of the research paper. Its analysis is based entirely on shareholder benefits as represented by stock price, and not on stakeholder benefits.  Therefore it is not speaking to the same things as the NYT article.  Stakeholder primacy was ‘invented’ in order to avoid the ills of shareholder primacy; such as the continuing increase in wealth-gap, and, growth-based business models that are causing devastation of the environment. From a systemic view, shareholder primacy is like a group of friends purchasing an SUV, then saying: “We only care about the benefits/losses to the people who invested in the SUV, and not to anyone else; even though we are using the same roads, the same air, the same supply chains, and the same petroleum as everyone else.”  The question “whether doing good is good for business” has a simple answer, in my opinion. Every business benefits from a stable society and a dependable environment: that is where they get both their employees and customers from. Therefore, healthy society and environment are resources for every business. Therefore, businesses must show responsibility towards the resources that they consume. In financial terms: businesses must pay the cost of the resources that they consume.  The paper says “ESG expenditures generate insufficient returns and hence reduce shareholder value” : if we now add the ‘resource consumption’ model I mentioned above to the calculations of returns -- it should be quite clear that, even if returns remain in the same ballpark as for non-ESG companies, ESG companies are consuming (or destroying) less resources therefore their overall value is higher.  All of the mathematical analysis, such as in Fig 2 which indicates that ESG only contributes 3% to the stock’s performance -- is a reductionist analysis. Is it even valid for complex adaptive systems?  A strong supporter of ESG investing is Hiro Mizuno (link below), former exec at Japan’s 1.4 trillion dollar pension fund GPIF. His talk is worth listening to: “at the end of the day as a community, asset owner owns the capital market so we need to make the capital market more sustainable, and for the capital market to be sustainable, society must be sustainable and for all the society to be sustainable environment must be sustainable”.  Here, in this Systems Change group, we are in the business of changing what business does in terms of its social/environmental impact footprint. Aren’t we?

I'm also in some with Saskia on Whatsapp. We have also used linkedin groups. What i like about linkedin threads is it has strong personal identification so people are likely to find each other, and may connect. Linkedin groups is ok for that, but has very negligible reminders when there are new comments. Each person is also limited in the number they can have so it becomes difficult for all to reserve one spot for us without leaving another group to make room. We have a google group for this already, i can reinvite anyone not in it if that helps. Or we can establish whatsapp, or linkedin group, or alternative channel. Other friends have suggested telegram or signal.  Slack is good in some ways, feels impersonal in others. LinkedIn keeps a limit of 50 people in the messenger group. I have a longer list invited to the series on Fridays but I try to only add to this thread those who have participated in our live discussions.",INBOX

Not exactly a feminist point of view. And, bringing this around, I actually had a chat with a vegan the other day who argued that feminism and veganism are inseparable - she couldn't reconcile, in her words, taking a mother's milk and eggs (and supporting male chicks being killed because they don't produce eggs) and still being feminist. I'd never thought about it that way, and I suspect a lot of folks would call that a stretch, but it definitely gave me pause and made me reevaluate how those values intersect for me.",INBOX

Which, again in a systemic fashion, came back to haunt us in terms of health impacts.  Have we forgotten how the hormones given to cattle has reduced the age of puberty *by several years* of girls particularly in poorer regions?   We need broader discussion on ""financialization"": how using finance metrics for everything has skewed them into becoming industrial production lines.  Even in gender equity discussions, McKinsey produced a widely-distributed report on the trillions of dollars that the economy is losing by not having women participate fully in the workforce.

But I don't think they were meant for us, either - we made these choices based on ethical grounds more than anything else. This may be controversial, but it might also be helpful to know that many of us believe that future generations will look back in shock and disbelief that we so casually manufactured the slaughter of billions of animals *every year* to consume cheap, medicated meat products. It's a profound moral failure that very few people talk about. But going back to Saskia's question, I don't necessarily think we will or everyone should give up eating meat - systems change doesn't mean everyone has to adopt my lifestyle. Rather, going back to sustainable cultivation and consumption, regenerative agriculture, that feels like the proper equilibrium. ",INBOX

Voice recording on locked screen- For something to work on the Lock Screen, the background permission and setting has to be enabled in the app. Apart from this, I'd have to understand how the web app works in handling audio. There may need to be some changes specific to the iOS platform to handle audio recordings.  2. My knowledge in React Native is limited. However, wrt native iOS development, I believe there may be delegates that can help handle native data to be passed on to the web view.  There can also be a button placed in the web app that  triggers some native swift code to retrieve clipboard data? Even probably on React, there are bridges to connect to native code, to handle certain actions natively.",INBOX

Regarding how I want to use ideaflow, here's a bit of background:   Right now, I'm in a transition period career-wise. I've been in the extension space for the past ten years. Seven years as the program manager of a Chrome extension development team and an early-stage startup (product and customer success). Three years ago, the Chrome extension team at Google contacted me to help improve their documentation and create developer learning journeys. I started to enjoy technical writing, and every year, the extensions team has asked me to continue developing new programs to improve the developer learning experience. But decided to explore other options.  For the past few years, I've been diving deep into self-development and what it takes to create a quality life for yourself. So last year, I signed up to be certified as a life coach to help developers understand themselves better to pursue a life they love.   My goal is to join a tech company or startup as a program manager and provide life coaching services as a side gig for developers.   So I will be networking, planning, preparing for interviews, and creating content, for which I will use ideaflow. I am in the process of learning how to reach my goals an keep my notes organized. I set a time to work on this tomorrow 😀.  > Btw, do you develop Chrome extensions? I personally have only managed extension projects and I created small code samples to teach more about how the platform works. But my strong point is making a product successful by understanding the user, creating processes, and bringing a team together.   But since I am deep in the space, I know many Chrome extension experts, in case you are interested.  Why do you ask? 🤔🧩",INBOX

We’re an agency that helps you hire remote workers, from the Philippines for $10-$16/hr.  Let's face it, in 2024 these market factors are looming over every business owner: 1. The Great Resignation 2. Rising Inflation 3. The Pandemic  However, it's not all bad news. See, there is a blessing and a curse.  A CURSE: Because it’s nearly impossible to afford and retain great workers in the States.   But also a BLESSING: Because with Work From Home normalized, we entrepreneurs now have access to an overseas labor force that has been groomed by Fortune 500 companies.  Right now there is an explosion of talent available from operations managers, to SDRs, to office admins, to remote receptionists, and even B2B sales reps. If it can be done remotely, our Filipino talent can do it!  Our model is win/win for everyone: For founders - we lower the risk. (No hiring fee, no hidden costs, everything is covered in the hourly rate)   For virtual assistants - we increase their benefits. (Providing medical, dental, vision, paid holidays, and PTO)  At Coconut VA, our goal is to help you outsource your operations so that you can finally go on that family vacation you’ve been postponing.

My name is Saleha Fatima and I work with CreateMyContent.   As a Tech Founder, you must be spending thousands of dollars every month to generate qualified meetings.

We hire interns, work very closely with them, and generate qualified meetings at less than 1/4th the cost.  We generate up to 4-5 qualified meetings per month with one resource at $600.  We have helped dozens of tech startups. And this model seems to be working. No long-term contract. You can get started with $300. The remaining $300 is to be paid at the end of 30 days. If we fail to get 4-5 qualified meetings, we won't bill you.   Can we get on a quick call to discuss this?

Here is a very small sampling of the format of how I’m thinking of stitching this together. It’s not necessarily in linear order – the outline is just a hierarchy of the points and responses.  https://docs.google.com/…/135Py-n8M8AL8csZUHeaoxS3QoqMy2Ot-…  Full Idea: Live stream annotated debate outline  Live stream an annotated outline of the debate...“you could watch the standard coverage of the debate, or you can watch our annotated live stream where we are outlining all of the points that are made, and arguments for and against, alongside it. Go to debateoutlines.com”  This outlining could be easily performed by a volunteer using a Google document, and I could help write a layer that transforms it into something that looks more presentable to the public in real time.  One key thing to note is that it should allow nesting of responses to sub points:  A real example taken from a debate my aunt was at in Palo Alto local government: Should we allow dogs at the Windy Hill preserve? - [pro] Women feel safer walking with dogs  - [refuted] [con] dogs disturb of wildlife  ——-[con] many nearby wildlife preserves, like the Baylands, allow dogs and have thriving wildlife Not Found docs.google.com Link for our outline is up!

I think your company is on an amazing track - in fact I have patents to my name regarding connecting ideas and concepts using human computer interfaces in ways similar to using AI to achieve advancements in understanding the interconnectedness of ideas, so what you’re doing resonates and I think has immense value.  I’m writing because my incredibly talented and driven daughter (Sydney Keller) has applied for your marketing associate position. So many times these days companies just ghost candidate and although I know you’ll get a lot of resumes for the position, I hope you won’t ghost her and at the very least will give her an opportunity to walk you and the team through how she would help you pitch the company to customers and investors. There’s so much noise out there about AI and generative AI in particular that the creative and thoughtful solutions like yours could really use someone like her to explain to investors and the public how you really are creating tools that stand out and are useful. So, I’m not asking to put a finger on the scale, I’m asking that your team act as humans and give candidates like her their opportunity to convince you that they’d move the needle for you.   when it makes sense, let me know if you’d be interested in getting some input from me directly on any relevant legal issues. I’ve been advising companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Instacart on AI before OpenAI was an idea in San Altman’s head.  Best regards - may Openflow be super successful!  Kevin",INBOX

Among other things, he went deep down the “building tools for research” rabbit hole in his own life when he got cancer and needed to really quickly do everything he could to get up to speed on the topic, and ultimately managed to save his own life. He showed off his own system he built (which he is actively using to solve additional health problems he has had subsequently) and now he sees the world’s larger problems as analogous to that cancer, and with the same urgency. He also sees life as being about going on meaningful “quests” with parties of people a la World of Warcraft, and some of his ideas connect deeply with what I’ve been thinking about re: building “the metaverse”/future of work.  He is from SRI, knew Doug Engelbart personally, and I can feel Engelbart’s spirit living through him.    Here is the inspiring ~40 min clip from Jack Park https://youtu.be/S_gScJAitg0?t=3180 – starting here.    Gets all the way from knowledge management to the metaverse/a quest manager for the world",INBOX

Did I mention we are also plugged into AI systems like ChatGPT and Copysmith?   Colleges, universities, and govt organizations across America love our platform and app. We are seeing more than 10x bookings on our initial forecasts!

We were discussing live today. We have had more than a year of discussion already including months of such in recordings. You made request in the document shared which is a high friction request. Discussing aspirations in recordings as we have released is low friction for the group when it is fresh. Writing down all of one’s impact goals in a spreadsheet is a wish. It does not follow user-centered instructional design. Track down “self-determination theory”. Process for people is not followed at the speed of bot but at the speed of shared intention. The process was shared as an improvisation. But people in collaborative networks are not staff to be handed a process. Even micro pilots may need more confirmation from people of purpose and constraints before process launch. I do think breaking down past dialogues as we have in dozens of clips connects to a knowledge graph. But I don’t think people create that without discovery of shared purpose and shared assumptions forging processes. ,INBOX

This groundbreaking project is around Medical Diplomacy and you can help in a small way.  Breast cancer is one of the two most common cancers all over the world. But the death rate for this cancer is astronomical for women in the middle east. Women typically do not seek help until they are stage 3 or 4 in most middle easter countries if at all. But women are so critical to our efforts toward peace and their health care is often marginalized. We have to help. That is why we chose to tackle this particular health crisis as our first initiative toward peace through Medical Diplomacy.  I am asking for your support in getting my article about Project Jericho out to the world! I believe this is the transformative project of my lifetime. In particular, I believe deeply that the secret to success is the involvement of women.  One way to support us is to comment on the article, second is to share the article, and third is to mention @robertstevenkramarz in the comment and share, with a statement of ""I'm behind you.""

I came across Ideaflow through Twitter back in September of this year, and I instantly connected with your mission and vision of what Ideaflow aims to be.  A little about me: My name is Jon Sundin. I'll be completing a Masters in Software Engineering this week. Before my masters program, I completed half of medical school. It was during medical school that I learned about the world of personal knowledge management and since 2020, I have written more than 13,000 notes using Obsidian. Also while in medical school, I experienced a complete shift in my worldview. This shift led me to re-evaluate my life trajectory as a physician. I decided I would dedicate my life to building intelligent software systems that could augment human intelligence to help solve the most challenging problems humans face.  Some of my technical experience: https://github.com/jmsundin  I am currently working on a data visualization project to query the Wikidata SPARQL endpoint using a simple dropdown menu form in order to visualize the hierarchical structure within a root node topic (https://github.com/jmsundin/Visualize-Wikidata). This project is using React, D3, and Vis-Network. I have experience with Python as well to do NLP -- using spaCy, scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy. I also have worked with R for data preprocessing and visualization using tidyverse.  I am eager to find a company and team of people that is also passionate about building software that not only supports the ""bottom-line"" but helps enrich the lives of all humans.

I love the work you do.  After checking your website and seeing you on Crunchbase, I saw that your website has a bounce rate of 57%. This means more than half of your website visitors are leaving your website abandoned. You should do something about it.   Now if you are interested, my name is Wahaj and my agency SaaSBean helps SaaS companies like you reduce bounce rates and increase conversions by revamping their website that connects with their customers.  Recently, we helped Connecteam increase their conversions up to 257% in the first 3 weeks after revamping their website.  Best of all, we all do this using a tested process that is 100% effective and makes your site super easy to handle.  Some of our clients include PlateIQ, VoiceOps, and Parabola.  So if you are interested in learning more about how we can get you more conversions, let me know what your calendar looks like.  Best, Wahaj",INBOX

You need to make the perfect code because if there’s a bug and something goes wrong, it could cost you thousands of $$$!  For building apps, features, designs … all of this is where perfectionists thrive  Yet 8 years ago, I had a realisation when I was completely overwhelmed in my tech business…  What made me awesome in one area doesn’t equate to success in other areas.   I took the framework of being perfect and tried to apply it to running my business.  The challenge is that it ended up creating more problems because … I didn’t know where to focus I was stuck in cycles of overthinking  And ended up procrastinating on big decisions  I didn’t want to make a mistake and appear like a failure, yet it was a self fulfilling prophecy.   Since understanding this, my team and I have helped over 400+ tech entrepreneurs to let go of the wheel ie perfectionism/control   So they can put their business on autopilot and double their business revenue.

We think this quality is essential in building the go-to place people where capture thoughts. It's unclear to me whether Roam is on a trajectory to get this right, or even has a team that could (real time collaborative text editor design is a highly specialized skill, and we have some of the few world experts on our team).  Listening to user feedback, we’ve learned that it is critical to prioritize mid to large scale performance because most avid alpha users have knowledge bases that are at a multi-thousand note scale, and having an instant memory extension they can rely on seems to be the biggest thing people want. (We aren’t targeting tremendous size yet, e.g. Jerry Michalski’s Brain, but making sure the basic experience remains slick and snappy for the majority of our target demographic.)

This is Yijia, and I'm one of the 30-ish alpha users of Ideaflow right now. A bit about me, I studied at Berkeley (Yes, Linus introduced me to Ideaflow) and right now am helping scale an aPaaS startup as a backend engineer.  What I'm drawn to the most is Ideaflow's theme centered around Kurzweil's Law, something that fascinates me and which I buy into. I've got some concerns about that too. I'm currently in the middle of examining the tools I use, and if I do choose Ideaflow, I want to be able to stick with it for a really long time.  Would you be open to having a call at some point to tell me a bit of the company's inception history and what your roadmap looks like? This would be a really good confirmation for me.

I’m with nCube, we build remote software development teams in Ukraine and Latin America.  I like to be well informed, so I did a bit of research and found that the average salary of Junior software devs where you are, is just about equal to the cost of Mid- senior level engineers in those locations. With that being said, if you have a need, our model could be very convenient for you, considering the little time difference between you and Latin America.  We are also covering all the recruitment process, as well as the office space and all the social benefits. You are only paying for the working hours when the dev starts working on your project.

Congratulations on filling up the coffers!  It would be super exciting to be working with Wendell, and going through the growing pains of an early stage startup.  That's the environment in which I improve and learn the most.  However i'm currently tied up at a startup that is trying to get its feet off the ground.  We are scheduled to launch beta of our MVP Q1/Q2 of next year for a followup funding round.  I wouldn't be able to leave right away given the circumstances in my current company but I will definitely be keeping tabs on your company as Wendell has vouched for you and has advised me to keep a close eye on your company.  He had some great things to say about you and the company.  Absolutely brilliant ideas that he wouldn't get too much into detail, and just going through a round of growing pains.  Thanks again for the connect!",INBOX

I’m fascinated with the concept of intelligence augmentation, from a first glance, everything we love, hate, respect or fear is a result of our cognitive experience including the local and existencial threats we are currently facing, as they say, we might be wrong looking to expand outwards when in reality the more interesting exploration is within the possibilities of consciousness, right now it seems like not only an incredibly exciting mission but an obligation to develop safe systems that allow us to coexist with AGI at least for a while, although I’m currently experimenting with a semi invasive brain to text interface, I’m looking for opportunities to get involved within this field and contribute/learn from your amazing projects, maybe now or maybe in the near future, for this reason I’d like to know if there’s any way to get involved with Ideaflow, I’m sure I’m not the smartest or most capable person in your consideration, but I can assure you I can figure it out, I mean some describe the engineering process as constant adaptation and I can adapt.   I appreciate the beauty of existence and the inspiring feats humanity can produce and I want this to be the challenge I put my heartbeats to, augmenting our capacity to appreciate, create and explore the world we live in.

Demo: Post a meeting with Sequoia   Ideaflow is a low friction team knowledge base and data integration tool that acts as an extension of your brain. First launching as a system to augment the intelligence of top tier research teams in finance and strategy, it has the simplicity of a notebook but recognizes known people, companies, and other entities as you type, bringing up all references or connections to them your team or existing knowledge systems have ever made. IdeaFlow enables users to seamlessly capture and stitch together fragments of information, amplifying their ability to solve critical problems.  At the heart of our platform is the concept of rich, graph-based notebooks. Unlike traditional notebooks or wikis, which are centered around pages filled with static, long-form text, IdeaFlow treats entities within pages — e.g. people, companies, ideas — as first-class objects. This makes it possible to enable users to capture relational information between entities, like a mind map, but without the scaling problems. This is part of what Tim Berners-Lee proposes as the potential for the future of the Web.Ideaflow is currently in private beta, is advised by former Reddit CTO Marty Weiner, had revenue of over $200K from paid pilots last year, and just raised $8M from top angels and VCs, including 8VC, First Round, Sequoia scouts, and Naval RavikantWe’re a team of 3 full time right now and looking for a few special people to play major roles which will have huge autonomy, creative freedom, and upward mobility. It would be amazing if any of those people can get as excited as we are about curating all kinds of lists of valuable information for the good of the world, connecting related ideas, personal information management/Memex’s, and generally, fixing the Internet :)  - a JavaScript engineer and an iOS engineer with great product sense to play major roles, who are up to the challenge of helping us build something at least as complex, seamless, and high performance as writing an IDE.  - We're also looking for a fast-typing, warmhearted operations person who is competently and passionately available to do whatever needs to be done do whatever needs to be done, and also could be a strong representative of the company in a context like a career fair. May have the potential to end up director of operations or chief of staff.  - NLP/ML/Web scraping/data integration expert— ideally familiar with dependency parse trees and has also written an interpreter, e.g. a LISP interpreter, at some point in the past.",INBOX

Mine  range from a list of places to find thoughtful content on the Web http://thoughtfulweb.jacobcole.net/ (add your favorites :)?), to specific lists, such as this one containing resources on chronic pain http://chronicpain.jacobcole.net/ , to another on climate change http://climatechange.jacobcole.net/, to spreadsheets connecting people in particular communities (e.g. this software maker forum http://madscience.connectordocs.com/).  Oh and here's a public list of my (and others') ""overflow"" of ideas http://hackathonprojects.jacobcole.net/  I'm remembering you were a big humanities person. I'm also a super literature nerd and swoon for artful/profound writing: http://quoteslist.jacobcole.net/ and http://bookslist.jacobcole.net/.   So cool about the margin notes as well! One piece of our mission is to make the Web into a giant canvas for margin notes so people can build on one another's knowledge. Among other things, we're building a chrome extension that enables you to write ""margin notes"" on any document or page on the web. Moreover, if you write a quote in your digital notebook and make some comments about it, it will magically show up as highlighted and hoverable any time that it appears on the web!",INBOX

I was just catching up with Raf, and he mentioned you are leaving Trusttoken?

FYI – We're 4 people right now, and we have plenty of problems, but I think they're very different than the problems with Trusttoken.

Ideaflow enables teams of users to seamlessly capture and stitch together fragments of information, amplifying their ability to solve critical problems.  In this discussion, we'll demonstrate how Ideaflow can be used to augment the social intelligence of entrepreneurs and investors, and discuss the emerging field of IA (Intelligence Amplification), which is on a trajectory to becoming a defining entrepreneurial trend of this decade.  Vision: Ray Kurzweil projects that, by 2045, humanity will be hooked up to a ""shared neocortex in the cloud"" by brain-computer interfaces. We will leave the brain-computer interfaces to Elon Musk, but we believe it’s possible to build that ""shared brain"" now, and that it might look different than many imagine. We want to create a future where nobody feels alone with their ideas, where intellectual soulmates find each other, where superconnectors are empowered. We see our software as critical to creating the frame for humans and machines to work together to solve the world's most challenging problems.  Best, Jacob",INBOX

Yes, it's nice to see a fellow martial-artist! I've also enjoyed doing Taekwondo since I was young so it has definitely shaped a good portion of my childhood and continues to influence my life.   I'd love to be a part of a deep-dive discussion of Ideaflow! I would be most free on Monday 11 am PST so please invite me as I really enjoyed the talk yesterday! I enjoyed reading into Doug Engelbert's work after you shared it and also thought your idea of the world quest manager was by far the most intriguing and fun thing I've come across since my time at Stanford.   I actually talked to John-Michael for a bit after the live session regarding what positions Ideaflow was looking for. I am very interested in working on a project that has such immense potential implications on how people collaboratively think in the future! I believe that my core skill set relies on three things. First, I believe I have a diverse understanding of building out a product whether that be development, user testing, or interface design. Second, I know how to rapidly improve and learn based on feedback both as a person and in terms of iterating on user feedback for a product. I understand I may not meet the exact technical requirements for the development roles but I hope that my background in cross-platform app development will allow me to quickly improve upon my technical skill set and learn from the experienced engineers on Ideaflow's team. Lastly, I am an avid enthusiast of productivity tools or essentially anything that allows people to work together more efficiently and effectively. I love to cycle through and test all of these tools and learn about metholodogies such as the GTD method or the idea of a second brain with Roam. In terms of a dream job, I would love to be able to be in a position that is able to shape and influence any aspect of a product's development as I greatly enjoy front-end dev work and or simply talking about product strategy or analysis.   And I will be on the lookout for JS and iOS engineers as well! I am sure that there are plenty to be found at Stanford. Again, please let me know if the deep-dive into Ideaflow does happen! I'd love to be there and learn more.   ",INBOX

I get the sense we are deeply on the same team and same mission in the world :)  Also, it looks like you're a hard-core martial artist! I've been a lifelong kung fu practitioner and my biggest obsession these days is tai chi/qigong. Want to join a follow up discussion/Q&A next week diving deeper on Ideaflow and each other? There will be likely some very interesting people joining. Still scheduling, but if so, could Monday or Tuesday at 11am or 5 PM PT potentially work for you? Also, if you are interested in investigating working together, what are your core skillsets / what would be your dream job / role?  Lastly, do you happen to know anyone else who is a real ""on-fire intellectual""/writer/hacker/notetaker? Esp. if they are also a great JavaScript or iOS engineer / someone with a true toolmaker spirit? Even if they are not hireable for Ideaflow right now, these people are my crew, and I would love to meet them.

I saw you recommended by Sam Goto on LinkedIn –  I was Tim Berners-Lee’s research advisee at MIT and am working on a company with David Greenspan (creator of Etherpad, YC ‘07, which sold to Google) building a notebook that augments your intelligence as you type. First launching as a tool to augment the intelligence of elite knowledge work teams solving critical problems, it enables users to seamlessly capture and stitch together fragments of information, amplifying their ability to solve critical problems.   We’ve just raised over $8M from top angels and VCs, including First Round, Sequoia scouts, and Naval Ravikant.  We are right now working on tracking down a special sort of person with significant JavaScript experience who is up to the challenge of helping us build something at least as complex as writing an IDE. This person would hold a major role that can potentially can offer tremendous creative freedom and an opportunity to build the ultimate personal information management system. There is also the opportunity to do a lot of interesting machine learning (especially NLP/computer vision) work.  We deeply believe that what we are doing is on the critical path to unlocking the potential of the Web to vastly amplify humanity’s collective intelligence.

One key Verizon executive estimates that at least 40% of the work in the company is repeated either because new projects were started without full knowledge of what is already being worked on or because there were already related projects across multiple companies that Verizon has acquired. Moreover, the problem is not just that work is being duplicated – people within a company who have worked on or are working on related projects often have resources or expertise that could greatly accelerate or support each other.    IdeaFlow is a shared brain for organizations, a platform to connect people to related ideas and relevant resources from within their own organization.

We’ve begun by launching a human-AI hybrid platform for teams of analysts in financial industries to integrate business ecosystem data from multiple sources (e.g. Pitchbook, Crunchbase, internal CRMs), recognize references to the same people from across these databases, and visually explore the resulting knowledge graph. Users can further enrich this graph with missing information through an ultra-low friction notetaking interface and by importing internal spreadsheets, resulting in a “shared brain” for the entire organization.   We see this as the first step of the larger project of creating a platform for collaborative cognition, which many see as the “hybrid car” of automated cognition. IdeaFlow is lightweight, enterprise and consumer-ready implementation of the sort of smart personal/group knowledge base system AI thinkers have dreamed about across the decades, from Vannevar Bush’s Memex <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex> to Niklas Luhmann’s Zettelkasten <https://takingnotenow.blogspot.com/2007/12/luhmanns-zettelkasten.html> to Tim Berners-Lee’s Giant Global Graph <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Global_Graph>.

We help with that by creating short animated explainer videos that grab people’s attention and explain what you do, ensuring your message is heard.

This research is focusing on startups which are using AI technology and trying to understand how these startups can facilitate Design Thinking processes. As we did some desk research, we discover that your Company/Startup, is suitable for our research and we would like to kindly ask for the possibility of interviewing you. The interview will be accomplished through Skype, will last maximum 1 hour and if you’ll agree, recorded. The result of the research will be promoted in the annual report of the observatory, which will be submitted to more than 700 innovators and service providers following the activities of our observatory. I hope you would have time and give us this chance to have an interview with you. Best regards,  Behshid Baradaran",INBOX

However, more time passes, and DApps, at least as they are conceived by the Ethereum community, still have not found a breakthrough use case. We believe that another conception of DApps, which we call “vertically decentralized applications”, have even greater potential, and in fact will be how the majority of applications on the Web are built in the future.   We believe that the Ethereum and related communities so far think of DApps in too limited of a sense. They focus on the creation of what we call “horizontal DApps,” apps that distribute symmetrically across all nodes – for instance, systems such as decentralized exchanges or messaging apps. We believe there is even greater potential in another class of DApp, the  ""Vertical DApp.""  “VDapps” are applications which have the different layers of their data processing (and even UI) stacks decoupled and outsourced to third party service providers.  Now, you might ask: isn’t this what  already happens when we build apps that use APIs? The answer to this is yes. However, the revolutionary power of VDapps lies in the fact that, unlike in a monolithic application,  the API’s a VDapp uses are not set in stone by the original app developer, but instead can be swapped out at runtime by the end user with any other API that conforms to the same input and output standards.    Consider a developer building a VDapp that needs to use an API to perform Named Entity Recognition, a common natural language processing task.  Instead of specifying that the app will use a particular API for this, such as AlchemyAPI or the Intellexer API, developers will simply write a placeholder component that links to the standard for named entity recognition modules. Then the end users’ application, at runtime, will select a current and appropriate API that  satisfies  this standard.  We expect a number of third-party API reviewing services to emerge, and for VDapps to automatically select the highest rated API per one of these services.     This is good for application developers, consumers, and, most of all, API developers. In traditional monolithic applications,  it is dangerous for developers to use  all but the most stable of third-party APIs because it is out of their control whether an API is going to remain alive in the future, change its price, or change its interface.   When API’s change,  applications simply break, and  the original developers  must scramble to  update all the applications they have that use them.  Often, they never get to this, and, with traditional monolithic application architectures, third-party developers  have no ability to step in to help. Often, applications simply break – For instance, Firechat, the app that helped the Egyptian revolution, no longer works, because a it called internally shut down.  In short, monolithic architectures makes it difficult, if not impossible, to create software that can last for decades without constant maintenance by the original developer.  This is revolutionary for API developers. It introduces a powerful new market dynamic – previously, an API developer who builds a better OCR library, for instance, needs to market this library to developers and convince them to switch, which is a tremendous amount of work. But in the future that we are creating, the moment an API reaches the highest spot on a popular ranking site, it will have millions of users instantaneously.  The natural way to implement payments for API calls made over this protocol is a token. This token will act like a universal AWS API credit that applies to all APIs",INBOX

The natural way to implement payments for API calls made over this protocol is a token --  interested in your thoughts as to which token has the lowest transaction cost these days. This token will act like a universal AWS API credit — you buy credits for one API but these credits are usable across all APIs   The free market is arguably the most successful technology ever designed for mobilizing human collective intelligence. Where market dynamics are able to operate freely and rapidly, we see the fastest innovation and the most efficient delivery of value to society. By contrast, in industries where there is vertical lock-in and little modularity, innovation stagnates.  From airline booking websites to the touchscreens in cars, where  there is no space for free market competition, we see stagnant technology. By contrast, consider the touchscreens on android phone handsets -- they are very high quality – because they are a modular component and there is direct competition unfettered by lock-in through vertical integration we think our new paradigm for software development may produce as large a jump in productivity as that between innovation in the automotive UX space and innovations in phone handsets.  Because applications are locked together by vertical stacks of technologies, a third-party developer who builds a better component at any specific level of the stack, if they want their component to be used or be commercially successful, must do the hard work to build an entire app, or discover and market to the developers of each of these existing apps. Even in the best of cases, with developers who are the most competent marketers of their technologies, it often takes years for an innovation to penetrate the ecosystem fully, if ever it does.  Since there's no standardized protocol for specifying API’s inputs and outputs — and this which APIs' are interchangeable with each other — it's impossible to build apps this way, even if a developer wanted to. Fixing this will be one of the implications of our protocol and token project succeeding. We believe the majority of applications built in the future will be constructed this way.  An example of how IdeaFlow is a great breakthrough use case of this: A frequently requested third-party extension to IdeaFlow.io (our main non-token data integration / company knowledge base platform) is an extension that can read in a photograph of a business card and perform OCR (optical character recognition) to identify the name of the person and the company.  A second extension that has been requested is one that can read in a photo of a table full of multiple business cards, split them into individual business cards, and scan them in. We would like the latter developer to be able to release just their specialized service, and not have to make a commitment about which OCR API to use as the second processing step.

However, more time passes, and DApps, at least as they are conceived by the Ethereum community, still have not found a breakthrough use case. We believe that another conception of DApps, which we call “vertically decentralized applications”, have even greater potential, and in fact will be how the majority of applications on the Web are built in the future.   We believe that the Ethereum and related communities so far think of DApps in too limited of a sense. They focus on the creation of what we call “horizontal DApps,” apps that distribute symmetrically across all nodes – for instance, systems such as decentralized exchanges or messaging apps. We believe there is even greater potential in another class of DApp, the  ""Vertical DApp.""  “VDapps” are applications which have the different layers of their data processing (and even UI) stacks decoupled and outsourced to third party service providers.  Now, you might ask: isn’t this what  already happens when we build apps that use APIs? The answer to this is yes. However, the revolutionary power of VDapps lies in the fact that, unlike in a monolithic application,  the API’s a VDapp uses are not set in stone by the original app developer, but instead can be swapped out at runtime by the end user with any other API that conforms to the same input and output standards.    Consider a developer building a VDapp that needs to use an API to perform Named Entity Recognition, a common natural language processing task.  Instead of specifying that the app will use a particular API for this, such as AlchemyAPI or the Intellexer API, developers will simply write a placeholder component that links to the standard for named entity recognition modules. Then the end users’ application, at runtime, will select a current and appropriate API that  satisfies  this standard.  We expect a number of third-party API reviewing services to emerge, and for VDapps to automatically select the highest rated API per one of these services.  which lists the required inputs and outputs such a module ought to have    This is good for both application developers and consumers.  In traditional monolithic applications,  it is dangerous for developers to use  all but the most stable of third-party APIs because it is out of their control whether an API is going to remain alive in the future, change its price, or change its interface.   When API’s change,  applications simply break, and  the original developers  must scramble to  update all the applications they have that use them.  Often, they never get to this, and, with traditional monolithic application architectures, third-party developers  have no ability to step in to help. Often, applications simply break – For instance, Firechat, the app that helped the Egyptian revolution, no longer works,  because a it called internally shut down.  In short, monolithic architectures makes it difficult, if not impossible, to create software that can last for decades without constant maintenance by the original developer.   The natural way to implement payments for API calls made over this protocol is a token --  interested in your thoughts as to which token has the lowest transaction cost these days. This token will act like a universal AWS API credit — you buy credits for one API but these credits are usable across all APIs   The free market is arguably the most successful technology ever designed for mobilizing human collective intelligence. Where market dynamics are able to operate freely and rapidly, we see the fastest innovation and the most efficient delivery of value to society. By contrast, in industries where there is vertical lock-in and little modularity, innovation stagnates.  From airline booking websites to the touchscreens in cars, where  there is no space for free market competition, we see stagnant technology. By contrast, consider the touchscreens on android phone handsets -- they are very high quality – because they are a modular component and there is direct competition unfettered by lock-in through vertical integration we think our new paradigm for software development may produce as large a jump in productivity as that between innovation in the automotive UX space and innovations in phone handsets.  Because applications are locked together by vertical stacks of technologies, a third-party developer who builds a better component at any specific level of the stack, if they want their component to be used or be commercially successful, must do the hard work to build an entire app, or discover and market to the developers of each of these existing apps. Even in the best of cases, with developers who are the most competent marketers of their technologies, it often takes years for an in",INBOX

However, more time passes, and DApps, at least as they are conceived by the Ethereum community, still have not found a breakthrough use case. We believe that another conception of DApps, which we call “vertically decentralized applications”, have even greater potential, and in fact will be how the majority of applications on the Web are built in the future. We believe that the Ethereum and related communities so far think of DApps in too limited of a sense. They focus on the creation of what we call “horizontal DApps,” apps that distribute symmetrically across all nodes – for instance, systems such as decentralized exchanges or messaging apps. We believe there is even greater potential in another class of DApp, the ""Vertical DApp."" “VDapps” are applications which have the different layers of their data processing (and even UI) stacks decoupled and outsourced to third party service providers. Now, you might ask: isn’t this what already happens when we build apps that use APIs? The answer to this is yes. However, the revolutionary power of VDapps lies in the fact that, unlike in a monolithic application, the API’s a VDapp uses are not set in stone by the original app developer, but instead can be swapped out at runtime by the end user with any other API that conforms to the same input and output standards. Consider a developer building a VDapp that needs to use an API to perform Named Entity Recognition, a common natural language processing task. Instead of specifying that the app will use a particular API for this, such as AlchemyAPI or the Intellexer API, developers will simply write a placeholder component that links to the standard for named entity recognition modules. Then the end users’ application, at runtime, will select a current and appropriate API that satisfies this standard. We expect a number of third-party API reviewing services to emerge, and for VDapps to automatically select the highest rated API per one of these services. This is good for application developers, consumers, and, most of all, API developers. In traditional monolithic applications, it is dangerous for developers to use all but the most stable of third-party APIs because it is out of their control whether an API is going to remain alive in the future, change its price, or change its interface. When API’s change, applications simply break, and the original developers must scramble to update all the applications they have that use them. Often, they never get to this, and, with traditional monolithic application architectures, third-party developers have no ability to step in to help. Often, applications simply break – For instance, Firechat, the app that helped the Egyptian revolution, no longer works, because a it called internally shut down. In short, monolithic architectures makes it difficult, if not impossible, to create software that can last for decades without constant maintenance by the original developer. This is revolutionary for API developers. It introduces a powerful new market dynamic – previously, an API developer who builds a better OCR library, for instance, needs to market this library to developers and convince them to switch, which is a tremendous amount of work. But in the future that we are creating, the moment an API reaches the highest spot on a popular ranking site, it will have millions of users instantaneously. The natural way to implement payments for API calls made over this protocol is a token. This token will act like a universal AWS API credit that applies to all APIs",INBOX

Currently Democrats and Republicans donate vast amounts of money to their parties to cancel out the media noise from the opposing party.   My friend Sam Galler a graduate student at Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship, proposed that we build a website that acts as a clearinghouse for donations to political campaigns in the US. If you donate to the Democratic Party it cancels out the donations to the Republican Party. The resulting bag of saved money goes to charity.

We have a really great work environment that encourages innovation and creativity. We may operate in the finance world, but we act more like a tech company-- with a casual work environment, a hacker lab with a 3D printer and a robot, and over 250 learning and development events a year. Our unofficial motto is “We want to be the best place for nice geeks.”   We're always looking to hire great engineers, but unlike recruiters who simply try to pitch you on a specific job, we take a little different approach...I want to take a vested interest in what is most important to you in your career and get a better understanding of your specific interests. This way (if it makes sense to you) we can keep in touch about future opportunities that may be ideal for you, based on your specific interests and goals.
