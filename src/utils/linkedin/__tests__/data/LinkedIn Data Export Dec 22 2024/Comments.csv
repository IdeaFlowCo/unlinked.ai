Or whatshouldieat.ai 
It gives you two restaurants on the left and right side of the screen, and you choose which one you prefer
Then it gives you another screen with the chosen restaurant and other one of a different category 
You keep iterating til you have your restaurant! 

How fast could we build this with subframe?"
