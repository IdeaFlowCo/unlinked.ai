# Accepted Unlinked connections in OpenChat

With the sender and companion OpenChat receiver deployed, an accepted Unlinked
connection request queues one direct chat for both people in OpenChat (also
available in Unlinked Messages). Existing chats are reused. After successful
synchronization, the chat appears on the next chat-list load unless the receiver
suppresses the event as described below. Synchronization does not insert a message,
send push/email, or create an unread notification; existing Unlinked acceptance
notifications follow [member-connections.md](member-connections.md#notifications-mcp-servermember-notificationsmjs).
Opening an acceptance notification goes to that person's direct conversation in
Unlinked Messages (`/messages?profile=…`, resolved on the server; nothing is sent).
A person still presses Send to
message the other person. This is not an OpenChat friendship grant and does not
expand friends-only Context access or publish private profile/contact data.

The companion OpenChat receiver's confidential POST
`https://chat.ideaflow.app/api/unlinked/connections/accepted` uses the existing
`UNLINKED_MESSAGING_SECRET`, rejects browser Origin headers and ordinary agent
credentials, and validates the canonical Ideaflow issuer and two distinct opaque
subjects. The Unlinked server supplies identities resolved from active owner
bindings and the original accepted request ID/time. Neither names nor email are
identity evidence. Only display names accompany the identity; request notes,
private contact details and local Unlinked owner IDs are excluded.

A unique `UnlinkedConnectionSync.requestId` receipt pins the accepted event to its
identity binding. The receipt, inbox resolution and canonical DM creation commit
in one transaction. Ordered user ACL locks serialize this operation with blocks
and local relationship changes. An event reused with different identities or
acceptance time returns 409. Repeated and racing valid events reuse one receipt
and the same canonical pair DM. Blocked/bot pairs and local declined/removed
relationships produce a terminal suppressed receipt, so replay after unblock
cannot revive that event. A pre-existing OpenChat friendship is not changed.

Unlinked's durable accepted request is its delivery queue. Startup and five-second
reconciliation select at most ten due unacknowledged rows, resolve active identities
and recheck acceptance before dispatch. An immediate wake follows acceptance,
including crossed requests. Failures keep the same request ID and use persisted
exponential backoff from five seconds to one hour. Each HTTP attempt has an
eight-second abort timeout and refuses redirects. A lost response is safe to
retry. Acknowledgement is conditional on the same still-accepted request. Removed,
withdrawn, ignored, pending or deleted requests are not newly dispatched. Removal
in Unlinked does not delete an already-created chat or its history; a delivery
already in flight may finish. OpenChat's own block remains authoritative.

No credential is minted. Deploy the receiver and its additive constraint before
the sender worker. An absent messaging secret or one shorter than 32 characters
disables delivery; receiver outages
leave accepted requests retryable. Existing accepted requests without an ack are
reconciled as well. There is no external-send transport or subscription. Source
validation uses fictional identities and a disposable database only. Production
merge/deployment remains subject to the existing release-owner holds.

Validation in the companion OpenChat repository: server route and real Neo4j tests cover authentication, identity
conflicts, concurrency, DM reuse, suppression, no messages/friend grants; sender
behavior tests in [`tests/openchat-connections.test.mjs`](../tests/openchat-connections.test.mjs)
cover recipient authorization, crossed acceptance, lost response,
persisted retry, restart, removed requests and missing identity bindings.
